The PromotionsSolver program calculates the number of employees promoted under two different promotion policies (A and B) 
in a company hierarchy represented as a directed graph. Using a topological sort algorithm, it determines promotion eligibility based on dependencies between employees.

Key Features:
- Promotion Policies: Simulates promotions under two quotas (promosA and promosB), where higher-priority employees are promoted first.
- Graph Representation: Utilizes a directed graph to model dependencies between employees.
- Results: Outputs the number of employees promoted under each policy and those never promoted.
